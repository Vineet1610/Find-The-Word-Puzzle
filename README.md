# Find-The-Word-Puzzle
The game "Where's That Word?" was given as an assignment by the professor of my college. It is a 2-player game where the user has to find a word from the puzzle and will get points for a correct guess. The player who finds the last word gets a bonus and the player with most point wins the game.

This program is implemented in Python language. To play the game you need to run puzzle_program.py where it will list out the puzzle, words left to be found and entering a new word. You can use any of the text files puzzle1.txt or puzzle2.txt to play the game by changing the PUZZLE_FILE variable in the puzzle_functions.py.
